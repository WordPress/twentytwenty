# NEW ISSUES SHOULD BE CREATED ON TRAC

From this point on any new issues should be opened on the core trac instead of at GitHub to save them needing to be transitioned over there manually at a later point.

Please prefix tickets with `Twenty Twenty:` so that they are easy to find over there.

**Please do not create any additional issues here!**
